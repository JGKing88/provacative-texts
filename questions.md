#### What’s the meaning of life?

To ask that question is to insult the intelligence of the human race.
He stood up. "My name is Hari Seldon. I am the greatest man alive. I am the most
qualified man alive to judge the question of the future. But you are here, and you are
welcome."

To rid the world of scoundrels? Oh, if only there were a way. A way to rid the world of the unsavory types who clutter up the world.

I don't like it no more than anybody else. I don't like everything in life. I don't like the way anybody sits around and plays checkers all day. I don't like sitting around and pretending nobody's got anything better to do than sit around and pretend somebody else got nothing better to do. I don't mean that I don't like laughing and crying and all that stuff. 

I don't know, but I know who I am. I'm not gonna blow my own damn nose, that's for sure. Gee, that sucks, huh?

What's the secret of life? I say to myself over and over again, What the hell does that have to do with anything? I want to die. I want to die, but how? How do I get there? I don't know. I have no idea. Even if I did, I don't know if I could take the time to actually do it. I mean do it properly. I mean in the way the Bible says you should.

Why do I get up in the morning? Why do I even bother to go to school if I don't have to? If I don't have to do any of those things, I probably wouldn't even bother to get up in the morning. I probably wouldn't even bother--"


#### Is there a god?

“Yes. This is a god."
The elevator door slid aside and the woman stepped out. She wore no necklace, but her hair glistened softly in the lamplight like a snowflake, and her skin was glistening with a subtle radium sheen. "I came to tell you," she said. "I've come to tell you that they've taken Nick, and he dies, and you can't stop it." 

And then in a voice that was hardly above a whisper, "No, my lady, there is not. But I was a fool in the old days. I was led astray, led by men who did not know what was right and wrong, and it was I who followed them and it was I who damned them. Now I try to set things right. I will try to set you free."

Why do I suffer? Why does death plague me? I hear the voice of an unknown god."
The old man said: "There is none. But you are strong-willed, and your will is enlarged. Walk with me, young man, and see the world for yourself.”


##### Is life precious?

Do we even want to live? The answers are yes and no. Yes, we want to live. We want to keep living. And no, we don't. We're sick of the game. We're sick of watching the same TV show over and over. We're sick of the way our government is run. We're sick of everything, really.

Yes. This is what life is all about.
 It's not about the parties or the clothes or the cars or the boys. It's about who you are.
“Who are you?”
 He put the pad down and looked at her.
 She said, "I'm a woman. I came to Boulder to find out who I am."
 He put his arms around her and put his head on his knees.
 There was a  silence as he thought about that.

Is life precious?
Will it buy you a cup of tea? Will it save you from drowning? Will it end your hunger? 

 The answer was a bitter one.
 "It damn well isn't worth dying for," she said.
 "I know that!" he said. His eyes rolled in their once-glittering despair. "I know what you feel, I know what it's like to be alone, to want to just, to go away." 

Is it anything if it isn't yours?

Do we not know that we have been given a tremendous gift? Can we not use it?"
The old man shook his head. 
"Then we should use it-and do so with gratitude. Don't we know that gratitude is the source of all blessings? If we could only grasp that, we would be as well off as we are now. But we can't, and never will. Not even now, not by our own power"
